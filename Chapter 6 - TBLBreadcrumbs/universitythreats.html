            <h4 id="threats">University Threats</h4>
            <p>Having established the foundational principles of cybersecurity and their application within university
                environments, it is important to identify and understand the common cyber threats that universities
                face. These institutions are unique targets for cybercriminals; they hold vast amounts of sensitive
                data, including intellectual property from research projects, extensive personal records of students and
                staff, and financial information.
            </p>

            <h4 id="social-engineering">Social Engineering (Phishing)</h4>
            <div class="textwrap-image">
                <img class="textwrap-image" src="images/f7-4.png" alt="Flowchart depicting how attackers infiltrate network">
                <p>Figure 7-4: Flowchart depicting how attackers infiltrate network.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Threats can come from many directions. One form of threat is called social engineering. Social
                engineering is a branch of hacking centering around obtaining information or encouraging employees to
                take actions they otherwise should not – in other words, “human hacking”. A common example of social
                engineering is phishing attacks, where attackers disguise themselves as trustworthy entities to trick
                university students and employees into sharing confidential information. Attackers may even spend time
                studying their targets, where they work, what their interests are, and what their problems are; this
                information is used to craft highly personalized and convincing messages. This more targeted form of
                phishing, known as spear phishing, often involves emails that appear to come from trusted senders such
                as university administrators, fellow employees, fellow students, or even the financial aid office. The
                goal is to create a sense of trust or urgency and convince the recipient to click on malicious links,
                reveal confidential information, or download compromised attachments. These attacks are not only common
                but also increasingly sophisticated, making them a huge concern for university cybersecurity teams.
                According to Cloudflare’s 2023 Phishing Report, an estimated 90% of all successful cyber attacks start
                with phishing [1]. It is the golden first step for attackers aiming to breach university cybersecurity
                defenses. Once they gain access through a successful phishing attempt, they can exploit the network and
                further their malicious objectives from a better position. It’s easier to avoid detection, gain access,
                and cause issues as a student or employee than as an outsider. </p>


            <h4 id="malware">Malware and Ransomware</h4>
            <div class="textwrap-image">
                <img class="textwrap-image" src="images/f7-5.png" alt="Malware attack - Line graph showing malware attacks by industry in 2022.">
                <p>Figure 7-4: Malware attacks - Line graph showing malware attacks by industry in 2022.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Aside from phishing, universities also face significant threats from malware. Malware, or malicious
                software, refers to various types of software designed to harm or exploit any device, service, or
                network. The most common forms of malware include viruses, worms, and trojans – each of which operates
                differently. Viruses operate by attaching themselves to clean files within a computer system. Once
                attached, they spread throughout the system, corrupting data and disrupting functionality as they
                replicate. Unlike viruses, which rely on a trigger for activation, worms are more independent. Worms can
                infect entire networks when replicating themselves, not just a single system. They are essentially
                viruses with the capability to move autonomously across machines in a network, causing massive damage
                without the need for a trigger or user intervention. Lastly, trojans are a form of malicious software
                that is disguised as legitimate software to deceive users into loading and executing the malware on
                their systems. Trojans are particularly dangerous because they exploit user trust. Each of these
                malicious programs is designed to infiltrate and damage computer systems, steal data, or disrupt
                operations.
            </p>

            <p>Malware can be used to compromise university research data or hijack administrative systems, and the
                education industry is a prime target. Between 2021 and 2022, SonicWall’s Cyber Threat Report showed that
                malware attacks against higher education institutions increased by 26% <a href="https://www.sonicwall.com/medialibrary/en/white-paper/2023-cyber-threat-report.pdf" target="_blank">[2]</a>.
            </p>



            <p>Another prevalent threat is ransomware, a type of malware that encrypts data and demands a ransom for its
                release. Ransomware attacks not only cripple university operations but also pose a serious threat to the
                privacy and security of sensitive information. It can make university data inaccessible and cause
                serious financial implications, not just in terms of the ransom demanded but also due to the costs
                associated with system recovery and data loss. Moreover, ransomware attacks often lead to a loss of
                trust in an institution's ability to safeguard sensitive information, which can have lasting
                reputational damage. Like malware attacks, ransomware attacks pose a significant threat to the education
                industry and universities. From 2018 to mid-September 2023, 561 ransomware attacks were confirmed on
                schools and universities, resulting in a breach of 6.7 million records and an estimated downtime cost of
                about $53.4 billion <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/school-ransomware-attacks-worldwide" target="_blank">[3]</a>.
            </p>

            <h4 id="vulnerabilities">Vulnerable Networks and Programs</h4>
            <p>One of the most challenging issues in university cybersecurity is the weakness of their massive computer
                networks. Universities typically have vast networks that support a wide range of academic and
                administrative activities. These networks not only connect the campus computers and servers but also the
                thousands of devices brought in by students and staff, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops. In
                addition, each semester brings in a new wave of students each with their own devices that can be
                potential entry points for cyber threats. This dynamic nature of university environments along with the
                variety and volume of devices creates a complex network that can be difficult to monitor and secure.
            </p>
            <p>The complexity of these networks is further increased due to the fact that many universities still rely
                on legacy systems – systems that are old or outdated and may not be equipped to handle modern cyber
                threats. These legacy systems often have known vulnerabilities that are easy targets for hackers, and
                it’s not always easy to upgrade these systems without breaking existing network functions and spending
                copious amounts of money. At the same time, missing even a single software update on one system can make
                a university more vulnerable to an attack <a href="https://www.fierceeducation.com/technology/top-5-cybersecurity-threats-facing-higher-education" target="_blank">[4]</a>. Universities must find a balance between managing their
                existing networks and devices and upgrading them accordingly to prevent vulnerabilities – a task that is
                both complex and resource-intensive. </p>
