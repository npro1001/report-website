            <h4 id="critical-issues">Critical Issues</h4>
            <p>Universities represent the fundamentals of learning and growth in academia for the 21st century. Jobs and
                companies looking to push for innovation and creativity rely on universities for giving individuals
                degrees that are meaningful and full of actual educational sustenance. This is done internally through
                the university through grades. Grades are used systematically to evaluate individuals progress in
                retaining and applying technical understanding and skills to their academic field of choice. This
                concept of grades are a cornerstone of the academic process and are treated as such by implementing
                measures that support integrity throughout. Integrity is so important that acts by students such as
                cheating are enough to remove individuals from the university to uphold the grading process. When a
                student receives the letter 'A' in a class, this qualitatively assigned metric assures both the
                university and future employers that the student understands the material and can apply it close to
                flawlessly.
            </p>

            <p>The advent of computerized grades and assignments has opened up a new avenue that could possibly degrade
                the integrity of the grading process. Many universities still operate on legacy software and computers
                <a href="workcited.html">[5]</a> that pose unique cybersecurity challenges. Since grades and assignments continually are moved
                online, universities must be equipped to respond to possible threats that could sabotage assignments and
                grades. Students, who are increasingly familiar with this online format, can be possibly inclined to
                want to find ways to change their grades. The motives for changing students' grades remain the same, but
                since most of the academic format being moved online students may feel a sense of anonymity if they
                breached logins or databases in an effort to change their grade. This impersonal act can be viewed as a
                'victimless crime', but in reality has far reaching consequences.
            </p>

            <p>Students who change their grades online hurt the academic process, thus chipping away at the cornerstone
                that grades represent for academic integrity. Preventive measures are put into place at universities
                such as simple access controls involving separation of accounts and databases. Sadly, as many
                cybersecurity incidents have shown previously, these access controls can be trivial to bypass.
                Additionally, freely available programs such as VPNs can make it extremely hard to trace exactly where
                the attack came from. Publicly available code that performs exploits against enterprise software
                combined with easy-to-use tools to increase anonymity may provide even more motivation to an already
                disgruntled student looking to change their grades or those of others.
            </p>

            <h6 id="grade-manip">Previous Instances of Grade Manipulation</h4>
                <p class="leftpquote">"Students have been caught already changing grades within school systems"</p>
            <p>Students have been caught already changing grades within school systems. In March of 2019, several
                highschoolers were caught modifying their grades on the schools e-learning system <a href="workcited.html">[6]</a>. On a separate
                occasion, a university student named Trevor Graves from the University of Iowa was caught hacking into
                his school system from 2015 to 2016 <a href="workcited.html">[7]</a>. This student carried out a rather simple attack using a USB
                <a href="glossary.html#keylogger">keylogger</a>. A keylogger is a device that, once plugged into a computer, allows the recording and capture
                of any keystrokes including usernames and passwords. Graves strategically targeted a few professors that
                himself and friends had been in class with and gathered their usernames and passwords. Between his
                personal grades, and friends' grades, Graves changed grades up to 90 times. Since the university did not
                implement any form of two-factor authentication, Graves upon collecting the passwords was simply able to
                login and change his grades. This was a rather simple attack but was able to go unnoticed for almost a
                year, until a university professor noticed grades changing that she had not authorized.
            </p>

            <p>The breach at the University of Iowa caught the attention of the local FBI field office, who then got
                involved. This attack could have been preventable by simple administrator policies that would have
                limited potential USB access, thus preventing the keyloggers being used in the first place. Additional
                log-on security such as two factor authentication, considered an industry standard, would have also
                prevented or alerted the affected 
                professors. The total investigation of the breach cost upward of
                sixty-five thousand dollars, which pushed the university to file federal charges.
            </p>

            <p>Furthermore, another similar attack took place at the <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/hotforsecurity/university-of-kansas-student-used-keylogger-to-change-grades">University of Kansas</a>, where an unnamed student used
                a twenty-dollar keylogger to get access to the official grade system, where he was able to change his
                course grades multiple times from 'F's to 'A's <a href="workcited.html">[8]</a>. This was immediately suspicious to an academic
                advisor, who noticed that a student was on academic probation from previous grades while receiving the
                current honors Dean's List. Again, a very simple device that virtually anyone can purchase was used in a
                malicious way to unfairly alter grades.
            </p>

            <p> These instances of students changing grades at university systems highlights several key concepts about
                how cybersecurity relates to universities. First, most of these incidents took place in the last decade,
                and while cybersecurity is an ever-changing field, most of the current cybersecurity methodology has not
                changed. Being an integral part of the academic process, grades need to be protected. Simple changes to
                IT management practices can help secure the integrity of the grade process.
            </p>

            <h6 id="breach-pii">Previous Breaches of <a href="glossary.html#PII">PII
                
            </a></h4>
            <p> Despite cybersecurity breaches resulting in students wanting to change their grades for academic gain,
                another risk factor must be considered when dealing with IT security at universities. Universities
                require records of students, including medical records, social security numbers, and financial
                information. It can even hold more sensitive HIPAA data related to behavioral records or medicine
                prescribed through medical campus personnel. Since universities are multi-faceted with the data they
                collect, they require very sensitive information on the students and staff that work there, and utmost
                care must be placed. Any breach of this centralized collected data can result in all of the possible
                risks to the university talked about above.
            </p>
            <p>
                When collecting data of any kind, two important concepts must be understood and implemented to secure
                data. Data-in-transit is data that moves fluidly around any form of <a href="glossary.html#Intranet">intranet</a>. For example, when a
                student tries to apply for a university, any data including sensitive data must be inputted through a
                type of online form. When the student submits this data, it ultimately gets sent to the university of
                choice. However, when the data leaves the students device, and crosses into the universities system, it
                is considered "in-transit". In-transit data needs to be protected the most, as outside parties could try
                to snoop on that data or even change it while the data is traveling. Most of this is done by encryption,
                which is hard to implement correctly.

            </p>
            <p>
                Data-at-rest, as defined by IBM researchers <a href="workcited.html">[9]</a>, includes "files, objects, and storag"e. This data is
                ultimately where all the information sources get aggregated into. This could include anywhere from
                network traffic monitoring archives to a student's financial aid status. All of this data is resting in
                some form of cold storage, which could be as simple as a flash-drive.. Most of this cold data needs to
                be accessed from time to time again, allowing the data to shift from being at-rest to being in-transit.
                The cold data also needs to be protected via encryption, and the password/key combination keeping it
                secure needs to be stored elsewhere, out of an attacker's reach. When the data becomes in-transit again,
                the data needs to be decrypted and then re-encrypted again, confirming to various global technology
                security standards including Public-Key Cryptography Standards, better known as (PKCS).
            </p>
            <p>
                All of these concepts of data relate back to universities in a very important way. Students as well as
                university staff need secure and reliable ways to store and receive data. In 2016, the University of
                Central Florida disclosed that in 2015 over sixty-three thousand individuals had data exposed that could
                be personally identifiable, known as PII (personally identifiable information) <a href="workcited.html">[10]</a> No legal damages
                were sought out for, but thanks to several recently passed laws outlighting liability due to IT
                incompetence and due failure to secure, if this breach were to occur again, legal damages would be most
                certainly sought after. The root-cause of the breach has not been publicly specifically pointed out, but
                one possibility is a <a href="glossary.html#POS_System">POS machine (point-of-sale)</a> was compromised with malware in the student union [11].
                This happened either due to an employee or student clicking on a suspicious link, or simply the lack of
                advanced <a href="glossary.html#Antivirus">antivirus</a> or endpoint detection led to common computer virus strain being able to take root
                quickly. More importantly, the incorrect usage of data in-transit and data at-rest led to the attackers
                being able to compromise the information once already inside the network.

            <h6 id="breach-research">Previous Breaches of Research</h4>
            <p> Research is a core tenant to most university systems. Graduate and post-graduate level research allows
                universities to receive more government grant money, earn prestige for the university fellows, and allow
                students to learn at a school from professors that are researching the most cutting-edge technologies.
                Unfortunately, bad IT practices can hurt this essential part of a university as well. </p>
            <p> Very recently, earlier in 2023, hackers sent out a mass-email to the student body and the staff of the
                University of Manchester. This email, from the malicious actors, informed the school that they had
                gathered close to 7TB which is the equivalent of hundreds of computer's worth of information on the
                school containing but not limited to research. In this specific scenario, the university administration
                did not have any motivation to comply with the ransomware notice. This was a quid-pro-quo situation, if
                the university pays money the attackers will not release their data and thus not opening the university
                up for all forms of liability. To this date, nothing has come of this data exposure, however the
                university has confirmed the unauthorized data access as well as the complete network compromise. This
                attack was most likely performed via social engineering, as the email lists specific professors that
                most likely fell for the electronic snare. This can be largely blamed on the lack of cybersecurity
                awareness training, or gateway link security for their email servers.
            </p>
            <p> In this very specific example, research data was stolen. This data could even be classified, leading to
                even more exposure to liability from the government. Along with research data, all forms of PII data
                were exposed. This can contribute to the overall degradation of trust that the staff and student body
                have in the schools data system.
