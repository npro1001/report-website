            <h4 id="understanding-cyber">Understanding Cybersecurity</h4>
            <p>Companies and media often toss the word “cybersecurity” around, and there are several valid ways it can
                be defined. A simplistic way to define cybersecurity is that it is the suite of technologies,
                methodologies, and practices that are designed to safeguard an individual's or organization's assets
                from potential threats in the digital realm. These assets can include anything that is considered to
                have value, ranging from computer systems, networks, and software applications to sensitive data and
                information. While the word cybersecurity can be viewed as a blanket term that encompasses various
                aspects within the IT security landscape, understanding the basic risks and protective strategies is
                paramount in today's interconnected digital ecosystem. Malicious actors constantly seek vulnerabilities
                to exploit, potentially causing devastating harm to individuals, universities, businesses, and even
                nations. As our reliance on digital platforms grows, both individually and institutionally, so does the
                reason to fortify our cybersecurity.</p>

            <p>After establishing a general definition of cybersecurity, it is essential to examine its core principles.
                These principles are confidentiality, integrity, and availability – often referred to collectively as
                the “CIA Triad”. Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to those who have
                authorized access. Integrity involves maintaining the accuracy and reliability of data. Finally,
                availability is about ensuring that information and resources are accessible to authorized users when
                needed. </p>

            <h4 id="cyber-in-universities">Cybersecurity in Universities</h4>
            <p>When applied to universities, these principles of the CIA triad are combined to protect many different
                types of data. These data types include the personal information of students and staff, academic
                records, graduate research, internal communications, and digital resources such as WebCourses and the
                student portal. Each data type demands specific cybersecurity attention. For instance, the personal
                information of students and faculty is safeguarded through confidentiality, ensuring authorized access
                only and preventing breaches of privacy. Meanwhile, the integrity of academic records and research data
                forms the backbone of every university, so they must be accurate and reliable at all times. Lastly, the
                operation of educational and administrative activities relies on the continuous availability of digital
                resources like the ones previously mentioned. Together, these principles of confidentiality, integrity,
                and availability form a critical framework for cybersecurity in any industry – especially in education.
                They not only ensure the protection of diverse and sensitive data but also uphold the integrity and
                efficiency of digital ecosystems.
            </p>

            <h4 id="technologies">General Cybersecurity Technologies</h4>
            <p>The dynamic landscape of cyber threats requires a multifaceted cybersecurity approach that constantly
                adapts and evolves. To address these challenges, universities have or must adopt a wide range of general
                cybersecurity technologies that integrate with either new or pre-existing IT infrastructure.</p>

            <h6 id="firewalls">Firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems</h6>
            <p>Firewalls are the primary line of defense in IT networking systems; their job is to monitor incoming and
                outgoing network traffic based on rules, and if certain traffic breaks those rules, it gets blocked. For
                example, the University of Central Florida decided that TikTok should not be able to have any
                communication with their university network. So, a firewall rule was set that blocks any outgoing
                traffic from the UCF network to any TikTok domain and blocks incoming traffic from any TikTok domain to
                a device on the UCF network. Firewalls have the power to do things like this, but they effectively block
                unauthorized access and prevent malicious traffic from entering the network. On the other hand,
                Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) have a different purpose. Their job is to actively analyze network
                traffic to detect and prevent vulnerability exploits. These systems are great for identifying attacks
                before they cause any harm, so if an attacker can infiltrate the university network, they can’t easily
                send malicious traffic without being detected.</p>

            <h3>Insert Figure 7-2</h3>

            <h6 id="antivirus">Antivirus and Anti-Malware Software</h6>
            <p>Universities can and should deploy antivirus and anti-malware solutions across their networks. These
                types of software are designed to detect malicious programs, isolate them, and eliminate them from
                devices. They must be regularly updated and regularly scan systems to ensure effective protection
                against the latest threats, but are sometimes bypassable depending on the type of malware, so they
                should not be fully relied on. Windows computers are typically used in university environments, and they
                come with a built-in antivirus software called Microsoft Defender. It is critical that Microsoft
                Defender is turned on and up to date on all university and personal Windows computers to protect against
                malware. </p>

            <h6 id="encryption">Data Encryption</h6>
            <p>In addition to antivirus software, encryption is used to protect sensitive data when it is sitting on a
                server or in transit across a network. By encrypting data-at-rest such as student records, research
                data, and financial information, universities can ensure that information is unreadable even if a breach
                occurs – stolen data has no value if you can’t read it. It is also paramount to encrypt data as it is in
                transit. Otherwise, an attacker can sit between two devices communicating, and “sniff” the traffic to
                read the data being transmitted. A common way that data is encrypted in transit is by using a virtual
                private network or VPN. A VPN creates a secure connection for remote access and is essential for faculty
                and students accessing university resources from off-campus.</p>

            <h3>Insert Figure 7-3</h3>

            <h6 id="2fa">Two-Factor Authentication (2FA or MFA)</h6>
            <p> Two-factor authentication is increasing in popularity across every industry, including education. It is
                a concrete way to enhance the security of user accounts, especially those with access to critical
                systems. 2FA adds an extra layer of security to user accounts by requiring a second form of
                identification after logging in with a password. This can be a one-time code sent to a smartphone upon
                logging in, a fingerprint, or a physical security key via USB. There are many forms of 2FA, and it is an
                excellent way to protect user accounts from being compromised. An attacker may be able to determine a
                password, but the extra security layer connected to something only you own is something very difficult
                to bypass.</p>

            <h6 id="training">Cybersecurity Awareness and Training</h6>
            <p>Aside from these few critical technologies used to protect university networks and devices, cybersecurity
                and training programs are of the utmost importance. Human error is the number one cause of successful
                cybersecurity attacks, so educating students and faculty about potential cyber threats, safe computing
                practices, and response procedures is paramount in protecting university environments.</p>

            <p>The combination of these technologies with a strong culture of cybersecurity awareness enables
                universities to build a strong defense against cyber threats. However, cyber attacks still occur and
                many are successful. These basic defenses, while necessary, are not one hundred percent effective at
                mitigating cyber risk. This underscores the crucial aspect of cybersecurity in any setting: the need for
                an in-depth understanding of the evolving threats. Recognizing the limitations of current defenses is
                not just about identifying gaps but also about understanding the specific challenges and vectors that
                attackers exploit.
